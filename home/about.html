       <h2>Clean Your Hand</h2>
      <div class="messagebox shadow" id="CleanYourHand">
        <ul>
    <li><strong>Wash your hands</strong> often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds especially after you have been in a public place, or after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing.</li>
          <br>
    <li>If soap and water are not readily available, <strong>use a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol</strong>. Cover all surfaces of your hands and rub them together until they feel dry.</li>
          <br>
    <li><strong>Avoid touching</strong> <strong>your eyes, nose, and mouth</strong> with unwashed hands.
     </li>

    <h2>Avoid Close Contact</h2>
      <div class="messagebox shadow" id="AvoidCloseContact">
        
        <ul>
    <li><strong>Avoid close contact</strong> with people who are sick</li>
    <li>Put <strong>distance between yourself and other</strong> <strong>people</strong> if COVID-19 is spreading in your community. This is especially important for people who are at higher risk of getting very sick.</li>
    </ul>
        </div>
          
     
    
    <h2>Stay Home</h2>
          <div class="messagebox shadow" id="StayHome">
            
            <li><strong>Stay home</strong> if you are sick, except to get medical care. Learn what to do if you are sick.</li>
      </div>
       
    
    
    <h2>Cover Coughs</h2>
     <div class="messagebox shadow" id="CoverCoughs">
            
            <ul>
    <li><strong>Cover your mouth and nose</strong> with a tissue when you cough or sneeze or use the inside of your elbow.</li>
    <li><strong>Throw used tissues</strong> in the trash.</li>
    <li>Immediately <strong>wash your hands</strong> with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not readily available, clean your hands with a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol.</li>

          <h2>Wear A Facemask</h2>
          <div class="messagebox shadow" id="WearAFacemask">
            
            <ul>
    <li><strong>If you are sick:</strong> You should wear a facemask when you are around other people (e.g., sharing a room or vehicle) and before you enter a healthcare provider’s office. If you are not able to wear a facemask (for example, because it causes trouble breathing), then you should do your best to cover your coughs and sneezes, and people who are caring for you should wear a facemask if they enter your room.</li>
              
              <li><strong>If you are NOT sick: </strong>You do not need to wear a facemask unless you are caring for someone who is sick (and they are not able to wear a facemask). Facemasks may be in short supply and they should be saved for caregivers.</li>
